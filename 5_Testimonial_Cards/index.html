            I find myself recommending <a href="roadmap.sh">roadmap.sh</a> to
            all the internees or junior developers. It's great way to skill up
            and grow in your career.

          <a href="roadmap.sh">roadmap.sh</a> is an incredible resource. | was fortunate to discover it during my university days in 2018. Back then, it was just a single repository with images. It's amazing to see how much impact it has had on millions of lives since then.
